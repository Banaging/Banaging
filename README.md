- 👋 Hi, I’m @Banaging
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding and finding a way to earn through coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java and c++. I've learned this in school, 
  but since the pandemic I've unlearned most of my programming skills because I had to focus on finding a job and taking care of things here at home.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller projects where I can learn from the collaborator and the project itself.
- 🤔 My skills are somewhere on the beginner-intermediate scale, since like I previously mentioned I've unlearned some of my skills during the pandemic, I'm currently relearning them.
- 📫 How to reach me you can contact me here or on my instagram @Monc.ster
